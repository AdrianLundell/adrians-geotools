-------- EOP TOOL DOCUMENTATION --------

EopTool loads two eop-files in .eop, .eob, or .fil format, interpolates them to a common sampling frequency and caluclates the trend of their residuals.
The file with the original sampling frequency (or epoch) is called the primary file, while the interpolated frame is called the secondary frame.


Graphical user interface
----------------------------------------
The first row of plots show the loaded series with their residuals in the middle. The second row shows their sigma values.
Each plot has a tool bar where you may pan, zoom, adjust axes and save the plot.

The control panel to the bottom left has the following controls:
    -Data A, Data B: Write or navigate to the data files. The radio button to the right determines which frame is used as the primary one.
    -Year min: Lower bound of the displayed data serie
    -Year max: Upper bound of the displayed data serie 
    -Sigma max: The maximum allowed sigma value, either as a percentage (show best xx% of values) or as an absolute threshold.
    -Year offset: the year used as year zero in the trend regression
    -Selected serie: Which serie from th data file to use (x-wobble, y-wobble or ut1)
    -Weighted: Weighted/ ordinary least squares 
    -Remove trend: Wheter to subtract the trend or show it as a line in the plots.

To the bottom right are the calculated trend of the residuals. Each box represent one term in the equation (with t offset by the specified amount)
    A + B(t) + Csin(t*2pi) + Dcos(t*2pi) + Csin(t*4pi) + Dcos(t*4pi)
The checkbox determines wheter the value is calculated by the program or entered by the user.

At the bottom are two statistics calculated of the trend fit, chi squared and weighted root mean squared. 


Library
----------------------------------------
The code is documented with doc strings. Try for example in python

    import EopTool
    help(EopTool)
    help(EopTool.calc)
    help(EopTool.calc.predict_residuals)

or look up automatic documentation generation tools: https://wiki.python.org/moin/DocumentationTools
Also check out the example "cook book" file eop_tool_ex under examples.
