--------- HELMERT TOOL DOCUMENTATION ----------

HelmertTool loads two trf-files in .sta format and helps studying their differences and finding the helmert transform between them through least square regression.
The program assumes that the two files use the same naming convention for stations.


Graphical user interface
----------------------------------------------
The plot to the right shows a world map where residuals are plotted between different stations. 
The upper plot shows residuals decomposed into North, East components while the bottom plot shows the Up components. 
The plot has a tool bar where you may pan, zoom, adjust axes and save the plot.

The control panel to the left has the following controls:
    -Transform from, transform to: Write or navigate to the data files. 
    -Select stations: A button bringing up a list of stations with checkboxes to include or exclude certain measurements.
        -Default: Selects the stations specified in the transform_sites.txt file 
        -Sigma: Sort stations on sigma value
        -Name: Sort stations by name 
    -Weighted: Weighted/ unweighted fit  
    -N parameters: The standard helmert transform uses 7 parameters but the tools allow to have a separte
                   scale paramter for Z (8 parameters) or all three dimensions (9 parameters)
    -Calculate parameters: Calculates the parameters for the current settings.
    -Plot residuals: Plots the residuals for the transform with the current parameters 
    -Reset parameters: Sets all parameter values to 0.

To the bottom are the calculated helmert parameters and uncertainities for the weighted transform.
The checkbox determines wheter the value is calculated by the program or entered by the user.

At the bottom are two statistics calculated of the trend fit, chi squared and weighted root mean squared as well as an export
button to save a text file with the parameters and frames. 

Both the map and the file used for default stations are overwriteable by having a file named map.png or transform_sites.txt in your current working directionary. 


Library
----------------------------------------------
The code is documented with doc strings. Try for example in python

    import HelmertTool
    help(HelmertTool)
    help(HelmertTool.calc)
    help(HelmertTool.calc.calculate_parameters)

or look up automatic documentation generation tools: https://wiki.python.org/moin/DocumentationTools
Also check out the example "cook book" file helmert_tool_ex under examples.
